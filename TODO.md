- move services into implicit global packages (just be more idiomatic)
  - APIService -> api (FOSSA API under api/fossa, v2 under api/fossa.v2)
  - LogService -> log
  - ExecService -> exec (also add getenv)
  - FileService -> files
- test these packages using fixtures (it's really the only way to get true testing)
- factor out pure parts of parsing logic -- test these as units
- maybe put this all under /v2 or /next top-level dir?
